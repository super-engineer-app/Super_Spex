1. video streaming recording from the user B side. in the web-viewer there should be a button "record" and they should record audio + video (in a single video file) and be able to store it locally.
2. every participant in the channel should be able to mute/unmute
3. every participant should be able to turn their camera on and off.
4. add manual text entry option to tagging text (not only voice transcription.). 
4. Legacy imports cleanup
5. Remove 'any' keyword usage
6. Scan for unsafe language features
7. Glasses camera dimensions/quality options
8. Scan for legacy code to modernize
9. Video streaming optimization
