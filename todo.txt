in help mode, if you make a transcription then press "stop" and then start making a transcription again -> the old transcription is cleaned up instead of appending to the end of it.
the clean up should  only happen on the "reset" button. make sure next recordings add on top of existing transcribed text.

in the photo mode, there are 2 flashing lights : 1 saying recording.... and one in the top right of the screen just a light with no text. remove the "recording ..." flashlight from photo mode -> only keep the same flash light as in the video mode.

after making a video notes -> it keeps infinitely replaying in the preview, but it should be paused by dedfault and the user should be able to unpause / pause it at any point.
