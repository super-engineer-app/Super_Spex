in help mode, if you make a transcription then press "stop" and then start making a transcription again -> the old transcription is cleaned up instead of appending to the end of it.
the clean up should  only happen on the "reset" button. make sure next recordings add on top of existing transcribed text.

in the photo mode, there are 2 flashing lights : 1 saying recording.... and one in the top right of the screen just a light with no text. remove the "recording ..." flashlight from photo mode -> only keep the same flash light as in the video mode.

after making a video notes -> it keeps infinitely replaying in the preview, but it should be paused by dedfault and the user should be able to unpause / pause it at any point.

--- Speech recognition network fallback (in progress) ---
Problem: On emulators (and devices without language packs), the "speak to me" button in help mode
shows "language pack not available" and never falls through to the HTTP transcription endpoint.

What was done (2026-02-14):
- Made error 13 (LANGUAGE_PACK_ERROR) non-recoverable in isRecoverableError() so glasses ASR
  falls back to phone ASR instead of retrying in a loop (which caused repeated start/stop sounds).
- Added fallback from Google's network SpeechRecognizer to NetworkSpeechRecognizer (HTTP /transcribe-dia)
  in the onError handler of createRecognitionListener(). Previously the chain stopped at Google network
  ASR and just emitted an error.

Files changed:
- modules/xr-glasses/android/src/main/java/expo/modules/xrglasses/XRGlassesService.kt
  - isRecoverableError(): added ERROR_SERVER and LANGUAGE_PACK_ERROR (13)
  - onError(): added fallback block after the language pack → network switch, so if Google network
    recognizer also fails, it switches to usingNetworkFallback = true and starts NetworkSpeechRecognizer

Still needs testing:
- Verify the full fallback chain works end-to-end on emulator (glasses → phone on-device → Google network → HTTP /transcribe-dia)
- Check that TRANSCRIPTION_API_URL is baked into the APK correctly (BuildConfig)
- Confirm NetworkSpeechRecognizer actually records audio and gets a response from the backend
- Test on real device with language pack installed (should still use on-device ASR, no regression)
