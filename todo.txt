### PENDING:
1. video streaming recording from the user B side. in the web-viewer there should be a button "record" and they should record audio + video (in a single video file) and be able to store it locally.
4. add manual text entry option to tagging text (not only voice transcription.).
4. Legacy imports cleanup
11. Transcription on recording stop:
    - When user stops recording, prompt: "Would you like to make a transcription?"
    - If yes: "Are you sure?" confirmation
    - Mix all audio tracks (all participants + host) into single audio file
    - Send to /transcribe endpoint (accepts audio file, user_id, language)
    - Save both files: video+audio combined AND transcription text separately

### DONE:
2. ~~every participant in the channel should be able to mute/unmute~~ (implemented in web viewer)
3. ~~every participant should be able to turn their camera on and off.~~ (implemented in web viewer)
5. Remove 'any' keyword usage
6. Scan for unsafe language features
7. Glasses camera dimensions/quality options
8. Scan for legacy code to modernize
9. Video streaming optimization
10. Switch tagging API to HTTPS (remove cleartext HTTP workaround)
12. ~~Lobby/landing page before joining channel~~ (camera/mic setup, name entry, permissions)
13. ~~Participant grid view~~ (like Zoom/Google Meet, host larger and centered)
14. ~~Display names under participant tiles~~ (persisted in localStorage)
15. ~~Screen wake lock during streaming~~ (Android FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON fix)

### FUTURE FEATURES:
