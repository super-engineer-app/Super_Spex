the next big goal is to port the "demo" version of the spex app to 1. web 2. ios
we must make sure the demo version of the app runs everywhere - on android (the only place it runs right now), ios , and web.
the demo version only features hardware apis like camera, microphone, etc. so it is not based of the android xr and can be cross platform.

--- WEB PORT STATUS ---

[DONE] 1a. Speech recognition on web - Web Speech API with network-based fallback for Firefox
[DONE] 1b. Tagging phone button on web - delegates to getUserMedia (same as glasses capture)
[DONE] 1c. Streaming UI on web - Agora Web SDK, dynamic import, full streaming with viewer count
[DONE] 1d. Responsive web layout - useWindowDimensions, scales to 90% width (max 720px), native untouched

--- REMAINING ---

2. iOS port - not started yet (IOSXRGlassesService is stubbed in XRGlassesModule.ts)
