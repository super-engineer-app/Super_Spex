the next big goal is to port the "demo" version of the spex app to 1. web 2. ios 
we must make sure the demo version of the app runs everywhere - on android (the only place it runs right now), ios , and web.
the demo version only features hardware apis like camera, microphone, etc. so it is not based of the android xr and can be cross platform.
